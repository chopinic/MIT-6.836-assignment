## Remaining Problem:

pre-vertex normals calculation

Employ OpenGL texture mapping to render parts of your model more interestingly.


## Maybe later, or never:

Implement SSD using the vertex shader. You should store the bind pose in a vertex buffer, and define a set of uniform variables for the joint transformations. For each frame, upload the latest joint transforms, and compute the transformed vertex positions and normals in the shader.
